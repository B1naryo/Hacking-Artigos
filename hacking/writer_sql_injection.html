                <p>In this tutorial, we will see how to perform SQL injection on the login page of a website. We will learn how to use <span class="command">ffuf</span> to see if the login page is vulnerable to SQL injection by using different payloads from danielmiessler's SecLists. And at the end of this tutorial, we will see how to write a simple Python script to perform a LFI (Local File Inclusion) attack on the web application.</p>
                <p>This is the login page of the website.</p>
                <img src="../img/writer_sql_injection/001.png" alt="Login page of the website." title="Login page of the website.">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>It is a generic SQL injection payload to see if the web application shows some indication of a vulnerability.</p>
                <img src="../img/writer_sql_injection/002.png" alt="SQL injection to determine vulnerability." title="SQL injection to determine vulnerability.">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Let's enter the payload in the username and write some random string for the password.</p>
                <img src="../img/writer_sql_injection/003.png" alt="Entering the SQL injection in the login page." title="Entering the SQL injection in the login page.">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The SQL injection worked, and we are successfully able to login to the website.</p>
                <img src="../img/writer_sql_injection/004.png" alt="Successful login by SQL injection." title="Successful login by SQL injection.">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The assumption is that this how the query behind the login page probably looks like.</p>
                <img src="../img/writer_sql_injection/005.png" alt="Login page SQL query." title="Login page SQL query.">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The SQL injection modifies the query to check if 1 is equal to 1 (which it always is) and comments out the rest of the query.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Now that the SQL injection is done, let's do some deep dive into the web application. This is a GitHub page from danielmiessler which provides a very good list of SQL injection payloads that we could use for fuzzing.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p><span class="command">ffuf</span> is a good tool that can be used for fuzzing. Let's fuzz the username with the payloads downloaded from the above mentioned GitHub page. However, it returns a lot of results and we need to filter out the irrelevant ones.</p>
                <img src="../img/writer_sql_injection/008.png" alt="Using ffuf to fuzz the username." title="Using ffuf to fuzz the username.">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>We filter out the results that have 206 words <span class="command">--fw 206</span>. ffuf has managed to find five payloads that seem to work. Attempting all the five payloads with <span class="command">ffuf</span> allows a successful login.</p>

                <br>
                <p>All five attempts lead to successful logins to the website.</p>

                <p>The <span class="command">-x http://127.0.0.1:8080</span> can be used to route traffic through Burp Suite Proxy.</p>

                <br>
                <p>This shows one of the payloads that <span class="command">ffuf</span> sends. Note that the response length of this one is smaller than the rest and for the title it says "Redirecting | Writer.HTB". It can be an indication of successful login.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Our next goal is to see if we can read some files on the web server. Let's enter one of the payloads that works in the username field and some random text in the password field and click on "Sign in".</p>

                <br>
                <p>Once in Burp Repeater, the UNION injection technique can be used to determine what is returned back to us. We can see that only "2" is returned back. It means that we have one field to work with.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Let's see if a string can be returned back. And it does.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The <span class="command">LOAD_FILE()</span> function can be used to read files from the system. In this case we are reading the "/etc/passwd" file.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The next goal is to see if we can perform a LFI attack by brute-forcing filenames from a list. I have taken the script from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkvDid7xO7o">ippsec's</a> walkthrough and brought some minor modifications to it. This simple Python script retrieves the contents of the "/etc/passwd" file.</p>
                <img src="../img/writer_sql_injection/027.png" alt="Python script to retrieve the contents of a file." title="Python script to retrieve the contents of a file.">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>This returns the "/etc/passwd" file but with a lot of HTML content. We need to filter these out by using a regular expression.</p>
                <img src="../img/writer_sql_injection/028.png" alt="/etc/passwd file with a lot of HTML content." title="/etc/passwd file with a lot of HTML content.">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The regular expression in the script will retrieve everything after the word "admin". This is where the contents of our file starts.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Running the script returns the contents of the file but only the first line.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Adding "re.DOTALL" to the regular expression returns everything from the start of the file to the end of the HTML page.</p>
                <img src="../img/writer_sql_injection/031.png" alt="Retrieving the contents of the file using the Python script." title="Retrieving the contents of the file using the Python script.">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The Python script returns the "/etc/passwd" file but there is still some HTML that needs to be filtered out.</p>
                <img src="../img/writer_sql_injection/032.png" alt="Contents of the /etc/passwd file with some HTML content." title="Contents of the /etc/passwd file with some HTML content.">

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>We can see that when the contents of the "/etc/passwd" file ends, the next thing that comes immediately after it is the ending "&lt;/h3&gt;" tag. Let's add this to the regular expression.</p>
                <img src="../img/writer_sql_injection/034.png" alt="Regular expression to remove the HTML contents that comes after the file ends." title="Regular expression to remove the HTML contents that comes after the file ends.">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>This is better. The only thing retrieved is the contents of the file and everything else is filtered out.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>But what if we try to retrieve a file that doesn't exist in the system. The output in that case will be "None".</p>

                <p>The next step is to modify the script to identify the output when a file exists or when it doesn't.</p>
