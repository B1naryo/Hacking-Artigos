                <p>In this tutorial, we will see how to bypass a web application filter and perform directory traversal. We will be using the unicode character "%ef%bc%8f" which translates to "/" in ASCII. The target performs normalization after the payload bypasses the WAF, therefore, allowing us to bypass the filter and perform directory traversal attack.</p>
                <p><a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/unicode-normalization-vulnerability">This</a> and <a href="https://jlajara.gitlab.io/Bypass_WAF_Unicode">this</a> page contains more information about this attack.</p>
                <p>This is the main page of the web application. It has links to a monthly and a quarterly report.</p>

                <p>Let's try to see if we can read the "/etc/passwd" file.</p>
